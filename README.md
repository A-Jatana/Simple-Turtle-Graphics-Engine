# Simple-Turtle-Graphics-Engine
This is a simple functional version of the turtle graphics engine. In general, a pen (usually called 'the turtle') is moved about virtual paper (the screen) 
in a direction and amount specified by a program with the goal of drawing a shape or figure. The pen can be moved without drawing, and the pen colour can 
usually be selected. Programs consist of the sequence of instructions that move the pen in the right pattern to obtain a specified shape.
